# Manhattan-Life-Data-Science-Files
This repo contains Python implementations for data science methods most pertinent to life insurance industry use-cases. 
These include various binary classification, multiclass classification, and regularized regression examples and implementations. 
Furthermore, a module `textual_data_handling.py` contains implementation for Latent Dirichelet Allocation -- encapsulated in a classifier that allows for training() and classifying() -- that is essential for handling any sort of textual data (i.e. medical keyword data / descriptions). 

This repo also contains two other projects associated with asset management. Due to privacy concerns, we only host the publically-available R source code here. These projects are: 
  * peer group portfolio analysis
  * ARIMA-based forecasting of mortgage-backed security "health data"

All implementations require Python 3+
